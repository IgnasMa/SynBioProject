The dataset is composed of 801 instances and 20531 attributes. Adittionally there is a data file for cancer type for each sample names "labels"

Data has N/A missing values, however it's know that technical biases for gene caprutes and sequencing might arrise, which can lead to "0" expression values. 
Imputation of data could be performed after clustering
